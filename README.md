# Password-Manager
Password manager with GUI. You can store the name of the website, login and password. You can search your password by website name. All info stored in database (sqlite). Passwords are incrypted. Also there is a login window, so no one will enter the program.

At the first run you should create app password by entering it twice
(first- creating database and writing your password. secod- enter to the program)

I know it's not perfect, but it is already usable)
